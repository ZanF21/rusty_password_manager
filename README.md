- [] auto complete
- [] password gen (dk what algo ill use for that)
- [] encryption (have started on that) (ssh ..... cause i dont like gpg)
- [] easy sharing across devices (maybe)
- [] colors ??? (a big maybe)

why am i doing this? casue i hate myself and would love to have a cli password manager ....
