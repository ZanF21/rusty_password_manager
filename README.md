cant be bothered now ..... will be a cli passmanager with
- [ ] auto complete
- [x] password gen (dk what algo ill use for that)
- [ ] encryption (have started on that) (ssh ..... cause i dont like gpg)
- [ ] easy sharing across devices (maybe)
- [ ] colors ??? (a big maybe)

why am i doing this? casue i hate myself and would love to have a cli password manager ....
why is it called `rusty-password-manager` ? ... idk 
why am i building this? i dont like the current password manager that im using casue its too complicated and filled with features ... im just building a pass manager with bare minimum features that i need and nothing more

have a great day .... dk how and why yyou ended up visiting this repo
